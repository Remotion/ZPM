# [ZPM](http://zpm.zefiros.eu/)
ZPM is the C++ package manager built for everyone who uses [premake](http://premake.github.io/)!  
We designed it to make it easy to use **libraries**, **modules** and **assets**.

# PLEASE NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS IN BETA

## Why ZPM?

* **Easy, cross-platform** package manager
* Integrates with [premake5](http://premake.github.io/)
* Both for using and publishing packages.
* All Git repositories supported, even **private** repositories.
* For packages, premake5 modules, and assets.
* Assets may be hosted using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/), and from urls.
