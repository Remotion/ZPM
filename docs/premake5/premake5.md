# Premake5
ZPM is built as a [premake5](http://premake.github.io/) module and is loaded *automatically*.   
We even make using premake5 **easier**:  

* **Update** premake5 with [`premake5 self-update`](../basics/commands/#self-update).
* Use **older** versions with `premake-<version>`, i.e. `premake-5.0.0-alpha9`.
* Easy **system wide** installation.

!!! alert-success "Note"
    `premake5` always refers to the **newest** version of premake5!
