# .build.lua File
The `.build.lua` file describes how packages are **built**.  
The file is in the form:

```lua
project "Test"

    files {
        "*.cpp",
        "*.h"
    }

    zpm.export [[
        includedirs "include"
    ]]
```

## Commands
The build commands can be found [https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Project-API](here).

# Export
To use our projects externally, we should export settings to the zpm projects using them.

```lua
zpm.export [[<commands>]]
```

Where

* `<commands>` Are the premake commands that projects using this project should also use.

# Options
A project may define options in its `.package.json` file, and a project using it may override the options in 
the `.package.json` file. To retrieve to option value you should use:

```lua
zpm.option(<name>)
```

Where

* `<name>` The option name.
