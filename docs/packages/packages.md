# Packages

## Sections

We split the Packages section:

* [Using](using) everything about **using** packages in your project.
* [Publishing](publishing) **publishing** your own packages.

And there are sections that are used by both **using** and **publishing**:

* [.package.json](general/.package) How packages are **defined**.
* [Versions](general/versions) How **versioning** works in ZPM.
* [Dev](general/dev) How you can **develop** libraries using ZPM.
* [Overrides](general/overrides) How you can **override** given build files.
